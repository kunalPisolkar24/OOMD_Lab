Welcome to the repository for the **Laboratory Practice IV (410247)** course, focusing on Object-Oriented Design and UML, part of the Fourth Year Computer Engineering curriculum (2019 Course) at Savitribai Phule Pune University. This repository provides practical implementations and resources to help you master object-oriented modeling, UML diagrams, and design patterns.

🏛️ **Course Information:**

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| University | Savitribai Phule Pune University |
| Course Name | Laboratory Practice IV (410247) |
| Credit | 01 |
| Practical Sessions | 02 Hours/Week |
| Examination Scheme | Term Work: 50 Marks |

🎯 **Learning Objectives:**

* Understand the core concepts of object-oriented modeling and its advantages.
* Demonstrate proficiency in creating use-case models, sequence models, and state chart models for various problems.
* Explore the unified process approach to software design and development.
* Translate software requirements into object-oriented design implementations.
* Choose and apply appropriate design patterns to facilitate the development process.
* Describe the principles of designing and managing design patterns.

💡 **Course Outcomes:**

Upon successful completion of this laboratory course, students will be able to:

* **CO1:**  Describe the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and basic class modeling.
* **CO2:** Create class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and interaction diagrams to model and solve problems effectively.
* **CO3:** Select and apply the most suitable design pattern for a given problem.
* **CO4:** Analyze software applications, architectural styles, and software control strategies.
* **CO5:** Develop class design models and make informed decisions about legacy systems.
* **CO6:**  Understand the principles and applications of design patterns.

📂 **Practical Implementations:**

| Practical No. | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | **State Model for Telephone Line:** <br>  Design a state model (statechart diagram) for a telephone line, illustrating its various states and transitions (e.g., idle, dialing, ringing, connected, disconnected). |
| 2 | **Basic Class Diagrams:** <br>  Create basic class diagrams to identify and describe key classes, data types, and their relationships within a software system.  |
| 3 | **Use Case Diagrams:** <br>  Develop one or more use case diagrams to capture and represent the requirements of a system. Include a template for each use case describing its purpose, actors, and steps for various scenarios. |
| 4 | **Activity Diagrams:** <br>  Create activity diagrams to model business workflows or represent processes similar to flowcharts. |
| 5 | **Component Diagrams:** <br> Design component diagrams for a system, assuming you will reuse existing components and develop new ones. Illustrate the relationships and dependencies between components.  |
